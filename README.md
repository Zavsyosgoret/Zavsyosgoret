- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zavsyosgoret
- 👀 I’m interested in learing the basics, how to code, how do computer and web work, how to make programms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, watching online courses, reading about Python specifics and how to use it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that gives usefull practical expirience.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm out of reach I guess, cause distances in Russia are flexible.
